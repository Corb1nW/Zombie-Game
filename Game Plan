Problem: 

(100 pts) Zombie Game You are required to implement an Agent Based Modeling game. A relatively large amount of agents are required. Both Zombies and Humans are required to have variants. For example, humans can have multiple roles, such as Doctor and Hunter. OOP design is required. Database is required to store the states of agents. Parallelism is required in the implementation of the game body. Hyperparameters are required, such as the Zombie-Human ratio. You are also required to propose and conduct at least two studies of dynamics of the game, such as the dynamics of the populations of Zombies and Humans. You will detail your studies in an academic style write-up. You will present your work to Fanchao. 

 

 

Game Plan: 

Create simple agent-based modeling game 

Increase complexity of game (add roles for each, increase # of agents, additional abilities and pick-ups) 

Set up data base and properly organize it 

Connect data base to store states 

Implement parallelism in game body  

 

Game Features: 

Zombies: 

Regular – attracted to larger groups of humans 

Deteriorated – slower speed, lower health 

Runner – increased speed 

Tank – Slow, heavy damage 

 

Humans: 

Regular - base stats 

Doctor – Has medicine, favors finding low health humans 

Leader – Attracts humans 

Hunter – Increased damage, aggressiveness 

Shield – No damage, chance an attack gets through 

Lone Wolf – Stays away from group but can see further away 

 

Dynamics to Study: 

What's more beneficial for human survival, more attackers, or more healers? 

Lone wolf or group mentality beneficial for human survival? 

How many humans turn into zombies 

 

Things Still to do: 

Implement Multithreading 

Finalize game dynamics 

Snapshot history for analyzing 

GitHub with files and break down
